Story: logging out
  As an adlib user
  I want to logout of adlib
  So that others cannot manage content
  
  Scenario: when logged in
    Given an adlib user with username: 'johndoe' and password: 'password' exists
    And I am logged into adlib as 'johndoe' with password 'password'
    
    When I visit '/adlib/logout'
    
    Then I should be on the page '/'
    And I should not be logged into adlib
    
  Scenario: when not logged in
    Given I am not logged into adlib
    
    When I visit '/adlib/logout'
    
    Then I should be on the page '/'
